Episode 4:

Still recovering from their lost man, the roboitcists 


  They knew they couldn't hold out much longer. The zombies were approaching and although they did know the 
  school better, they were in no position to hold off an army of hungry zombies. They had to think fast. The "Liam 
  experience" was not one they wanted to repeat. Just as everyone was begginning to fret, Nathaniel ran out of the
  compsci lab flying! He had made himself a pair of batman wings.
  
  "Let's GOOOOOOO!!!" Nathaniel shouted as he flew through the hall. 
  
  The students stared at him in disbeleif. This was just what they need. 
  
  "We've got this" shouted one student. 
  "Let's go kill some zombies!" exclaimed the other. 
  
  While they were still mourning the loss of their loved one, the students proceeded full speed ahead. They
  ran to the elevator and waited. After a few minutes the elevator came and the students took it down to three.
  The doors opened and the students bursted out, Nathaniel flying forth at the head. 
  
  It was a heated batlle. Shouts of pain were heard from both sides. For a while, it was unclear who was 
  in the lead. But after some time, it was evident that the children were loosing. One by one the kids fell back, 
  while the zombies only got stronger. 
  
  All hope was lost. All those still conscience, new they were going to lose. But then something happened. One of the
  most incredible things that has ever occured. Just as the students were about to give up, Roby Dick rolled in
  with his three sidekicks agent 4174, agent 6059, and agenet 9371. And all of a sudden, the tables turned. The 
  kids regained their strength and, with the help of their robots, were able to defeat the zombies. 
  
  After all ths zombies were dead, the five remaining kids ran upstairs with their robots following close behind. 
  Once they were all upstairs and safe they mourned their losses of their valiant friends who died to the hideous 
  zombies.
